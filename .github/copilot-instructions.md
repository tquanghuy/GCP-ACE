# Copilot Instructions for GCP-ACE Repository

## Overview
This repository is a study guide for the Google Cloud Platform Associate Cloud Engineer (GCP-ACE) certification. It contains structured notes and documentation on various GCP topics, including networking, compute resources, storage, and more. Each file corresponds to a specific topic and is named accordingly (e.g., `8-Networking.md` for networking concepts).

## Key Files and Structure
- **Topic Files**: Each file (e.g., `1-Billing.md`, `2-IAM.md`) covers a specific GCP topic. These files are numbered to indicate the recommended reading order.
- **README.md**: Provides links to external resources for further study.

## Patterns and Conventions
- **Markdown Documentation**: All files are written in Markdown format for easy readability.
- **Numbered Topics**: Files are prefixed with numbers to maintain a logical sequence.
- **Key Concepts**: Each topic file includes definitions, key features, use cases, and configuration details.

## Developer Workflows
- **Adding New Topics**:
  1. Create a new Markdown file with a sequential number and descriptive name (e.g., `9-New-Topic.md`).
  2. Follow the existing structure: start with a brief introduction, followed by detailed sections on key features, use cases, and configurations.
- **Updating Existing Topics**:
  1. Edit the relevant Markdown file.
  2. Ensure consistency in formatting and terminology.

## Examples
- **Networking Concepts**: See `8-Networking.md` for detailed explanations of VPCs, Cloud NAT, and routes.
- **Compute Resources**: Refer to `3-Compute-Resources.md` for information on Compute Engine and related services.

## External Resources
- The `README.md` file lists additional study materials and official documentation links.

## Notes for AI Agents
- Maintain the existing numbering and naming conventions when adding or updating files.
- Ensure all new content aligns with the GCP-ACE certification objectives.
- Use concise, clear language to explain technical concepts.

## Integration Points
- This repository does not include code or executable scripts. It is purely for documentation and study purposes.
