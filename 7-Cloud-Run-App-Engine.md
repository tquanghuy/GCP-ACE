# Cloud Run and App Engine

## Cloud Run

### Overview
- **Cloud Run** is a fully managed compute platform for running containerized applications.
- It is serverless, meaning you don't need to manage infrastructure.
- Supports any programming language, library, or binary.

### Key Features
- **Autoscaling**: Automatically scales up or down based on traffic.
- **Stateless Containers**: Designed for stateless workloads.
- **Knative Integration**: Built on Knative, enabling portability.
- **Pay-per-use**: Charges only for the resources used during request processing.

### Use Cases
- Web applications and APIs.
- Event-driven processing.
- Microservices architecture.

### Deployment
- Deploy using the `gcloud` CLI:
  ```bash
  gcloud run deploy SERVICE_NAME --image IMAGE_URL --region REGION
  ```
- Specify concurrency and memory limits during deployment.

### Integration with GCP Services
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**: Trigger services with messages.
- **Cloud Storage**: Process files uploaded to buckets.
- **Cloud SQL**: Connect to managed databases.

### Cloud Run Functions

- **Cloud Run Functions** are event-driven serverless functions that run in response to events.
- They are designed for lightweight, single-purpose tasks.

### Key Features
- **Event-driven**: Triggered by events from GCP services like Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, or HTTP requests.
- **Fully Managed**: No need to manage servers or infrastructure.
- **Scalable**: Automatically scales based on the number of incoming events.
- **Language Support**: Supports multiple programming languages, including Python, Node.js, Go, and more.

### Use Cases
- Real-time data processing.
- Lightweight APIs.
- Automation tasks.
- Backend for mobile or web applications.

### Deployment
- Deploy using the `gcloud` CLI:
  ```bash
  gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME --runtime RUNTIME --trigger-http --region REGION
  ```
- Specify triggers such as HTTP, Pub/Sub, or Cloud Storage events.

### Integration with GCP Services
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**: Process messages from a topic.
- **Cloud Storage**: Trigger functions on file uploads or changes.
- **Cloud Scheduler**: Schedule function execution at specific intervals.

## App Engine

### Overview
- **App Engine** is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for building scalable web applications.
- Offers two environments: **Standard** and **Flexible**.

### Key Features
- **Standard Environment**:
  - Supports specific runtimes (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
  - Automatic scaling and high availability.
  - Sandbox restrictions for security.
- **Flexible Environment**:
  - Custom runtimes with Docker support.
  - More control over infrastructure.
  - Suitable for applications requiring specialized libraries or frameworks.

### Scaling Options
- **Automatic Scaling**: Adjusts instances based on traffic.
- **Manual Scaling**: Fixed number of instances.
- **Basic Scaling**: Scales based on request queue.

### Deployment
- Deploy using the `gcloud` CLI:
  ```bash
  gcloud app deploy
  ```
- Define application settings in the `app.yaml` file.

### Integrated Services
- Built-in support for Cloud Datastore, Cloud Storage, and more.
- Easily integrates with other GCP services like Cloud SQL and Firestore.

### Exam Tips
- Understand the differences between Standard and Flexible environments.
- Know how to configure scaling options.
- Familiarize yourself with deployment and service management.
